Easily integrate a Revue subscription form in your WordPress blog.

== Description ==

This plug-in easily allows you to integrate Revue subscriptions forms within pages or display them as a widget.

Revue is a tool that lets you create newsletters within a few clicks. The tool can be used to gather existing content, order it, add some personal words and send out the resulting ready designed newsletter to subscribers.

== Installation ==

Installation is pretty straight forward.

1. Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/revue` directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress

1. Retrieve your API key from [https://www.getrevue.co/app/integrations](https://www.getrevue.co/app/integrations)
1. Copy your API key into the API fields and save the changes.

You can now use either the widget, or use the shortcode by calling `[revue_subscribe]`.
